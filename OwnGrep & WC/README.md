PitE Lab01
First set of Python in the Enterprise excercises

OwnGrep - Own implementation of grep function.
USAGE: Run the program -> type in data -> see "found.txt" to see what has been found. ".log" files names changed, so that they are easier to type in to the python console.

Zad2 - Words counter.
USAGE: Run the program -> type in data -> see "words_count.txt" to see what has been counted. ".log" files names changed, so that they are easier to type in to the python console.

BOTH OwnGrep & WC: Failed to implement validation - unable to pass int value as an argument of validating class. Built-in error "ValueError" popping up instead of validator, when wrong value is put in. How else could this be done?
